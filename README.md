# RASPBERRY PI IOT WORKSHOP BY KINABALU CODERS

## DEMO SAMPLE PYTHON PROJECTS

These are sample Projects that can be built on Python with integration to the Sense Hat

### WEATHER DEMO PROJECT

This project shows how we can obtain weather data from a dedicated online API and display the data on our Sense Hat display.

The source of the data is obtained from the following sources:
- https://athena.sabah.io/weather/kota-kinabalu.json
- https://openweathermap.org

To use the Open Weather Map, you are required to create a free account with them, and then generate an API Key. The API Key is used when getting data from OpenWeatherMap


### FLASK DEMO PROJECT

This project shows how we can create a simple web server with a small application that stores temperature data sent from a Raspberry Pi with Sense Hat.

The web server with mini Flask Web Application can be run on a PC, Raspberry Pi or even a Server that is either accessible in the local network/WiFi or over the internet.
